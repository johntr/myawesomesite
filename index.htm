<p>Jerry: You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist, don't you? Newer magazines. , Kramer: Oh, this power! Look what I'm doing! I'm dangerous, Jerry! I'm very very dangerous? Jackie: Oh Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding. Jerry: It, uh, rhymes with a female body part. , Kramer: Retail is for suckers. Elaine (looking out Jerry's window): Do you ever spit on anybody from here? Jerry: Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat. Kramer: Oh, guess again, tubby? Jerry: You know, George, they're doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set up a meet and greet. George: I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. Kramer: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go fill my freezer with my own blood</p>
